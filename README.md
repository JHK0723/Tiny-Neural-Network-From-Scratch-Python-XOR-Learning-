# Tiny-Neural-Network-From-Scratch-Python-XOR-Learning-
Built a fully functional neural network from scratch in Python capable of learning the non-linear XOR function. Implemented forward propagation, activation functions, backpropagation, and gradient descent manually without ML frameworks. Includes loss tracking and visualization over 200 training epochs to analyze convergence behavior.
